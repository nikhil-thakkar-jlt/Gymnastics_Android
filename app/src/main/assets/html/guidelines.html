<div class="content"><p class="intro">This checklist is a basic pre-game inspection tool that helps
    to identify safety concerns and record your actions on match day.</p>

    <div>
        <div><h2>What are You Looking For?</h2>

            <p>The checklist is a visual inspection tool only. It will help you to identify safety
                concerns such as:</p></div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Extreme Weather</strong> such as lightning, heat, rain, visibility (fog)
                etc.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Playing Surfaces</strong> such as holes, cracks, debris (glass, syringes)
                etc.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Game Formats</strong> as per the AFL &ldquo;Laws of the Game&rdquo; <a
                    href="http://www.afl.com.au/">www.afl.com.au</a></li>
            <li><strong>Hazards</strong> on or near pathways, exits or change rooms such as debris,
                protrusions etc.
            </li>
            <li><strong>First Aid</strong> including qualified personnel, first aid kits, ice etc.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Other Factors</strong> such as sun protection, spectator behaviour, signs
                etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div><h2>Action Stations!</h2>

        <p>Safety concerns should be addressed to an acceptable level and recorded before you start
            play. Here&rsquo;s some examples of actions you might take:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Control/reduce the outcome</strong> with caution signs, witches hats, roping
                off hazards, modifying the rules/game etc.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Avoid harm</strong> by removing the risk/hazard/object from the area,
                delay/postpone the game etc.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Transfer responsibility</strong> by written notice to players, spectators,
                the council or the insurer. Ultimately, this should be done prior to game day.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Accept and Monitor</strong> when there is little chance of an incident will
                occur. All safety concerns should be monitored throughout the day.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="note"><strong>Important Note:</strong> if safety concerns cannot be addressed to an
        acceptable level, the checklist should <em>not</em> be submitted. Play should not commence
        until conditions are acceptable to both teams.</p>

    <h2>Duty of Care</h2>

    <p>Clubs owe a duty of care to players, spectators and volunteers on match day. Insurance cover
        may not exist for clubs and/or officials who show deliberate negligence or disregard for
        these responsibilities.</p>

    <h2>Submitting the Checklist</h2>

    <p>Some people view the formal nature of submitting a declaration relating to risk and insurance
        as formidable. This is simply not the case and, if a reasonable attempt to identify risks
        has been made, then no concern is warranted. If reasonable care has been taken to provide a
        safe environment, then submitting the checklist puts the club in a strong position to
        demonstrate it has taken a duty of care.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>If the conditions are not safe&hellip;</strong> and can&rsquo;t be made safe for
            play, then it may be negligent to start playing. To play in these conditions is placing
            the club in a poor position to demonstrate any duty of care.
        </li>
        <li><strong>If something happens&hellip;</strong> and the checklist has been used properly,
            the club remains in a strong position to demonstrate its duty of care as it has shown
            reasonable actions to provide a safe environment.
        </li>
        <li><strong>If the checklist has&rsquo;t been submitted&hellip;</strong> and play commences
            in what appears to be normal conditions and an accident occurs resulting in serious
            injury, the club is in a poor position to demonstrate it has taken a duty of care.
        </li>
        <li><strong>The basic message is&hellip;</strong> the club and its members are in a better
            position if they complete and submit the checklist.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Protecting Club Officials</h2>

    <p>Legislation and insurance exists to protect club officials who complete the checklist thereby
        demonstrating their duty of care.</p>

    <h2>Insurance</h2>

    <p>An important part of your public liability insurance is that your club supports the use of
        match day checklists. By addressing risk before matches commence, you can reduce your club&rsquo;s
        exposure to injuries and/or legal action. Recording your actions on the checklist may also
        assist in the defence of legal action against you club.</p>

    <h2>When Should the Checklist Be Completed?</h2>

    <p>You should complete the checklist before the first match of the day. If conditions change,
        the checklist should be submitted again (even if the checklist has been submitted
        earlier).</p></div>
